# Denoising and Derivative Estimation from Noisy Data in the SINDy Algorithm

*Author: Jiaqi Yao, School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide*

This repository contains the code used for the experimental part of my Honours project.

This code framework is developed based on Ali-Forootani's code [1].
